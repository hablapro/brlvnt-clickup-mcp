 * ClickUp Task Service - Attachments Module
 *
 * Handles file attachment operations for ClickUp tasks, supporting three methods:
 * - Uploading file attachments from base64/buffer data
 * - Uploading file attachments from a URL (web URLs like http/https)
 * - Uploading file attachments from local file paths (absolute paths)
 *
 * REFACTORED: Now uses composition instead of inheritance.
 * Only depends on TaskServiceCore for base functionality.
