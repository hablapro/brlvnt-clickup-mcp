# ClickUp MCP Server Test Plan

## üéØ Objective
This test plan evaluates all 45 tools in the ClickUp MCP Server through diverse, natural language prompts simulating practical usage scenarios. Each test case includes verification methods and validates the TaskService composition architecture.

## üìã Test Data Preparation
Before executing the tests, you must generate the necessary test data in your ClickUp workspace:

1. **Create Test Spaces, Folders, and Lists**:
   - Create at least one space in each category (e.g., Development, Marketing, Design, QA)
   - Create folders within these spaces
   - Create lists within spaces and folders

2. **Create Test Tasks**:
   - Add several tasks with various properties (priorities, due dates, descriptions)
   - Create tasks with comments
   - Add tags to some tasks

3. **Update Test Plan with Actual IDs**:
   - Replace all placeholder IDs (e.g., "123456789") with actual IDs from your workspace
   - Update all task names, list names, folder names, and space names to match your actual data
   - Make sure all referenced entities actually exist in your workspace before testing

## üìä Test Execution

For each test case:
1. Execute the prompt against the ClickUp MCP Server
2. Capture the response
3. Verify the result matches the expected behavior using the specified verification method
4. Document any discrepancies or unexpected behavior

## üîÑ Maintenance

This test plan should be updated when:
- New tools are added to the ClickUp MCP Server
- Existing tools are modified or have parameter changes
- New edge cases or usage patterns are identified
- TaskService architecture changes that might affect tool behavior

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

**TaskService Composition Architecture:**
- All task-related tools now use the TaskService composition pattern
- TaskService composes TaskServiceCore, TaskServiceSearch, TaskServiceComments, TaskServiceAttachments, TaskServiceTags, and TaskServiceCustomFields
- This architecture eliminates artificial dependencies and improves maintainability
- All 33+ public methods remain accessible through the main TaskService interface
- Tools access TaskService through `clickUpServices.task` from shared services

**Testing Focus Areas:**
- Task CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Search functionality across workspace and lists
- Comments and attachments management
- Tag operations and custom fields
- Bulk operations and time tracking
- Error handling and edge cases
